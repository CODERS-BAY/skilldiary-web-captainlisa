### CSS3
* with CSS3 there are multiple ways to further style elements, like rounded corners, shadows and so on
* ```border-radius``` for rounded corners
* ```border-image``` for adding frame images
* ```text-shadow``` for adding shadow. the higher the px number, the smoother the shadow
* and many more (:

### Flexbox
* the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, is an important tool to structure a website and make it more responsive. 
* with ```.flex-container{ display:flex; }``` the flexbox is activated
* the different elements within the flexbox are marked with the class ```.flex-item```
* elements can be positioned on the main axis (left to right) with ```justify-content``` and on the cross axis (top to bottom) with ```align-items```.
* these to attributes must sit within the flex-container, not within the flex-item
* flex-items have different traits as well. some ways to adjust them are 
  * ```flex-grow: 0```: items can only grow to a certain size
  * ```flex-shrink: 1```: items can shrink lower than a certain size
  * ```flex-basis: auto```: the basic size of the item is set automatically
  * ```order: 1```: allows to arrange the items in a certain order 

### Color Theory
* Primary Colors: red, blue, yellow
* Secondary Colors: are mixed from primary colors: orange, green, purple
* Tertiary Colors: are mixed from primary and secondary colors
* There's hue, shades, tints, and saturations 
* There are different color schemes that you can use: monochrome, complementary, triadic, etc.
