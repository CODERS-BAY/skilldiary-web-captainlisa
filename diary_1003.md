## Practicing Javascript

* for forms there is a javascript function called ```reset()``` that deletes everything within the form
* with ```<input type="number">``` you can create an input element for numbers
* with ```<input type="image" src="" alt="">``` inside a ```<form></form>``` element, you can create clickable image-button.
* when using a button in html/javascript, be sure to write ```<button type="button"></button>```
* I learned AGAIN, that you have to embed the godforsaken stylesheet into your html file or otherwise it. won't. WORK!
* the datatype .svg document stands for 'scalable vector graphics'
