## Javascript Baby!

* is what makes a website interactive and responsive
* the code for Javascript is either in an individual file (like CSS) with the ending .js, or it is embedded directly in the html code (in the head or the body) by using the ```<script></script>``` tags
* if there is an external .js-file you need to reference it in the head just like CSS with the code:
  ```<script src="myscript.js"></script>``` 
* although Java and Javascript are not related to one another, there are some similar features. you can calculate things and use for-loops, if and switch and so on.
* there are no specific datatypes in Javascript. if you declare and initialize a variable you simply write ```var``` or ```let``` and the name of the variable: ```var number = 5;```
* there is a difference between integers and floats. 
* ```NaN``` stands for "Not a Number" 
* ```onClick();``` triggers the function that it gets as an attribute. 
* for example:
```<button type="button" onclick="nameOfFunction();">Click here</button>``` 
here, when the user clicks on the button, the function ```nameOfFunction``` is executed
* lazy loading = only parts of the website are loaded at the beginning. while the user is on the page and is able to scroll and interact with the page, some elements load in the background.
