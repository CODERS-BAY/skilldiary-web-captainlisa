### About building a Website
* there are different elements in the layout of a website, e.g. header, nav, content, footer
* use understandable names to name your data, like pictures, html-files, etc. 
* the main page of a website is always called index.html
* pay attention to lower and upper case, because most systems are case sensitive
* use different folders to organize your files, like img, src, css, js
