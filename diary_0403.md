## Javascript

* a button cannot have a value!
* practiced with for-loop, if and functions in JS.
* with ```document.getElementById("idName").innerHTML = "Hello"``` you can bring what you want to print out into your HTML, by calling the element with the ```id="idName"```, the text/variables you want to put out are put between the tags of the element you called at.
* **use ```console.log()``` to debug!!!** this prints out everything you give it as parameters into the console of your browser
* with ```Math.floor(Math.random() * 5)``` you can generate a random number from 0 to 5; ```Math.random()``` generates a random number without a range
