## Media Queries (and other things)

* ```screen and (mind-width: 302px)```
* ```screen and (max-width: 767px)```
* ```screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)```
* you can also define the height, device-width, device-height and orientation (landscape or portrait)
* meta-viewport in the html is a requirement, it makes sure that mobile devices use their actual viewport and not the virtual viewport
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no">
```
* &nbsp; = non breakable space
