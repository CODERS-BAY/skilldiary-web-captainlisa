### Difference Semantics & Syntax
* Semantics = is about the plain code as well. The divverent schriftzeichen
* Syntax = is about the meaning, the logical correctness of the code. the meaning of the different tags
* so you can work with the right syntax, but be semantically wrong

### About Tables and Forms
* tfoot can stand on top of the table or at the bottom, but on the website it will always be bottom
* the actualy data of the table is in the table body ```<tbody>```
* the ```<caption>``` tag is optional, it's like a title, but not necessary
* colspan and rowspan takes two cells and puts them together
* Forms: there are different input boxes for text:
     * ```input type="number"```
     * ```input type="password"```
     * ```input type="text"```
     * ```<textarea name="" cols="" rows=""></textarea>```
* linking a label to the input element is not only helpful for people with disabilities, but also for phone users. if you click on the label, the cursor automatically jumps into the input box

### Miscellaneous
* Crtl+# marks a code line as comment
* Pseudo classes are pre-defined, like ```::hover```
* classes are defined individually
